The model will predict heart disease with the help of 13 independent variables listed below. 
Attribute Information: 
 1. age  
 2. sex - can be male = 1 or female = 0 
 3. chest pain type (4 values) - from 0 to 3 
 4. resting blood pressure 
 5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
 7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
 8. maximum heart rate achieved 
 9. exercise induced angina  - Yes =1 or no = 0
 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
 14. target: 1 if yes, 0 if no(yes =has heart disease)
